# Project: Investigate Soccer Database


> This soccer database comes from Kaggle and is well suited for data analysis and machine learning.
It contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016.
This dataset is quite extensive, and we encourage you to read more about it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).

Research questions:
* What teams improved the most over the time period?
* What is the best player in penalties?
* Which factors lead to the most victories?
